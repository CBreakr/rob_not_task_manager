This project is intended to demonstrate basic React+Redux usage, but will hopefully turn into something more generally useful (if only on a personal level).

To see the application in action, please [click here](https://rob-not-task-manager.herokuapp.com/).

You can register as a new user and play around, or sign in as the "guest" account using the password "12345".

All accounts have the right to create new projects, over which they will have admin rights (read, edit, create child elements, delete).

The guest account has been given readonly access to the "task manager creation" project, which is where I'll be keeping track of my own tasks related to upkeep and improvement.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
